            <h1><b>Zypp Electric</b></h1>
            <p>Collaborated with a team to create a detailed business analysis deck on Zypp Electric, an emerging EV-based last-mile delivery startup.
             We explored its business model, market strategy, and growth prospects in the micromobility space. 
             The project enhanced my understanding of startup dynamics, industry trends, and sharpened my research and communication skills</p>

            <h1><b> “Mind the Gap: Using Data to Drive Strategy for Mumbai Locals”</b></h1>
            <p>
                Worked on a team project aimed at identifying and proposing solutions to tackle the overcrowding issue at Mumbai railway stations.
                 As part of the research and design process, I learned to use Figma to create clean, visually engaging slides.
                  This project helped me understand user-centric design and strengthened my skills in visual storytelling and collaborative problem-solving.
